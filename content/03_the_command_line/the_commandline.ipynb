    "## The Command Line Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces some basics of how to use a command line interface like the one pictured above. Examples of programs that let you interact with a command line interfaces are the MacOSX Terminal, Git BASH, Windows PowerShell or CMD.exe in Windows. Command line interfaces, also known as *shells*, allow you to accomplish many tasks by typing specific commands. If you've seen a TV show where hackers inactivate a satellite by typing cryptic looking commands, that is a fantasy version of using the command line. For example, you can use a command line interface to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- move files around on your computer\n",
    "- delete files\n",
    "- install new software\n",
    "- create, view, and edit text documents\n",
    "- run software\n",
    "- open a connection to a remote computer\n",
    "- etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to use a command line interface is a foundational skill in bioinformatics, and requires practice. This can be a bit dry at first, however, so in this chapter we will use a special set of files and folders developed for this text that will let you navigate a small adventure while practicing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already familar with how to use such an interface, feel free to skip this chapter, although you may find the exercise amusing nonetheless. "

    "\n",
    "#### Using command line workflows rather than graphical software can enhance reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging that you have designed a brilliant and successful bioinformatic analysis that has made a major contribution to science or medicine. After weeks of work, you realize that there was a mistake with the first step in your project, and you need to repeat your work. What happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "If all of your weeks of work happened in the way that many of us first started using computers - by pointing and clicking on what we wanted in programs with a graphical user interface (GUI) like Microsoft Excel - then you may be in for a great deal of frustration. You will have to redo all that work. If you took very careful notes - or have an exceptionally good memory - you may be able to speed up the process the second time. However, it will still be a lot of work, and it would be very easy to by mistake make some other change in your process that will affect the final outcome (and require repeating the process *again*). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that there were a way to simply type a few words into your computer and rerun your entire analysis, changing only the first step. This can be accomplished by using the command line to set up your analysis as a **workflow** - a set of clearly defined steps that when run in sequence generate your results from your starting data. Clearly, being able to recreate your results from raw data using a written workflow would make for both more reliable science, and a lot less frustration on your part. Command line interfaces can, with just a little extra care up front, allow you to do just this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is known as **reproducibility**. Whenever possible scientific research should be reproducible both by the people who did the research, and by other research groups. The ease of creating reproducible workflows is a major motivator for using command line software in scientific research."

    "#### Much scientific software can only be run on the command line\n",

    "When programmers develop a program with a sophisticated graphical user interface , the design of that interface often takes significant effort. For scientific software, the number of users is often relatively small, so many cutting-edge packages may not necesarily have a graphical user interface included. Instead, you use the text commands on the command line to specific any of the options or commands you would normally have set in a graphical interface."

    "\n",
    "If you go on for a little while in bioinformatics, you will find that you can be very greedy in terms of the size of datasets you analyze. Once you have a method working on a small data set, running it on a much larger one often only takes extra time on a computer, rather than very much extra work on your part. However, eventually the processing time for your analysis may get too long to do on a standard laptop or desktop. One solution is to break your problem up into smaller pieces that can be run at the same time - i.e. *in parallel* - and then run those pieces on a group of computers that are working together known as a computing cluster. Typically you have to know how to use a command line interface to work on a computing cluster. If you already develop your reproducible workflows in command line interfaces on your own computer, then it is much easier to move to a compute cluster if you need to. "

    "## A little terminology -  shell vs. terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Although for most practical purposes its fine to think of a command line interface as a single \"thing\", in truth there are some distinct components, each with their own term. Let's take a moment to discuss these components, just so if we hear these terms later on, we have a pretty clear idea of what each one means:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **shell** is the software that actually interprets the commands you type into the command line interface in order to make things happen. Some of the most common shells are [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (short for **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell), which is used as a default on many Linux machines; [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (short for **Z sh**ell), which in 2019 replaced BASH as the default shell on MacOSX; and [Fish](https://fishshell.com/). On Windows, [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a shell that comes pre-installed on Windows machines. Any of these shells will work just fine as you learn to use a command line interface, and once you have learned one, the others will be much easier to navigate as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **terminal** is a software program that lets you interact with a shell. This creates the graphical window in which the results of running the shell are displayed, usually along with some menus or keyboard shortcuts that make it easier to interact with the shell. Some examples include the MacOSX [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) program; [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) terminal or [Microsoft Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) on Windows; or the [xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) or the [GNOME terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/) on Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between a shell and a terminal matters a little bit because you can use terminal programs to run more than one shell. For example, you might have a `bash` shell running in one terminal and `zsh` shell running in another terminal. Conversely, on some systems, like any Linux system, you can access a shell like bash directly, without a terminal running.  The distinction between shell and terminal also matters because you will hear the names of terminal programs and shells thrown around, and it is useful to have some idea which is which."

    "\n",

So by installing Git BASH, you will both be getting set up with useful tools for coding later on, but also a convenient command line interface that will work the same as other common command line interfaces. This is nice, since it means that folks on Windows, Linux or Mac can follow along throughout the rest of this chapter with exactly the same commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install git, and along with it the Git BASH command line interface, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Head to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Click the Download link for your system** (either Windows, MacOSX or Linux) to download the Git installer\n",

However, for most of the BASH commands discussed in this chapter (ls, cd, pwd, mv) can still be run in PowerShell. This is because PowerShell treats these as *aliases* or alternative names for it's own command. When you type them, it internally translates the command into a standard PowerShell command before running it. So you can use PowerShell to practice some command line basics, even though technically its commands are structured differently.\n",

However, if we type a space after ls and then a relative or absolute path, the ls program will modify its behavior to show us the contents of whatever is at that path. Try this in your commad line interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "  `  ls ../`\n",
    "  \n",
    "This way of supplying information to a program is called a *positional argument*. The computer will interpret the first word you type (i.e. whatever letters happen before the first whitespace) as the name of the program you are running. For programs that use positional arguments, subsequent words will be interpreted as arguments with specific meaning based on their order. For example, the mv command moves files or folders from one path to another. You tell it which is which by listing the 'from' path first and the 'to' path second.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So in technical terms, what we have done when we ran `ls ../` is to run the `ls` command, and supply the relative path `../` to it as a positional argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's nice about this system is that we can now use `ls` to look at any folder we want by changing the positional argument. If we replace `../` with any relative path or any absolute path, we can make `ls` list what's in any folder on our computer. For example, I have a folder `/Users/zaneveje/` on my machine. I could use a command like `ls /Users/zaneveje` to list what's in that folder. The image below breaks that command down into the command itself and its positional argument: :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/images/program_name_vs_arguments.png\" width=\"300\" align=\"center\"  description=\"A graphic with the name of the command ls enclosed in a big orange box. Next to it the text /Users/zaenveje is encolosed in a big green arrow pointing at the box with the ls command. The graphic is supposed to convey that the argument /Users/zaneveje is being sent to the ls command\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from our discussion of relative paths up above, `../` is the relative path to whichever directory encloses the directory you are currently in (i.e. one step back towards the root). When you supply `../` as an argument to `ls`, you are telling it you want to list the contents of whatever directory encolses your current one. Note that you *must* type `ls` and then the relative path - if you simply type `../` or some other path like `/Users/zaneveje` the computer will interpret that as the name of the program you are trying to run, and complain that no such program exists."

    "### Value or Flag parameters supply information in any order\n",
    "\n",
    "The other main way that command line programs can be given infromation is by **valued parameters** or **flag parameters**. To explain why these are useful, consider the following (true) story. Imagine you were trying to run a complex bioinformatic program that took more than 20 separate inputs to run. Now imagine that you had to type them all in as positional arguments in the correct order to get it to work. It might looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    evil_program 0.17 True ./genome_sequences/ 50000 True False True True 100 Spearman etc etc etc\n",

In the command python pick_otus.py --help, python is the program, pick_otus.py is a positional argument sent to that program, and --help is a flag parameter sent to that program. Positional arguments and parameters modify a programs behavior.\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem of how to supply lots of information is addressed by using valued or flag parameters. When you pass these parameters to a program you tell it what value you are setting. Therefore you can give them in any order. Here's the same program with valued parameters. While it might still look complex, you have a much better shot at getting the input right and remembering what each value means:\n",
    "\n",
    "    less_evil_program --similarity-threshold 0.17 --input-sequence-dir ./genome_sequences --save-output True --verbose False --multicore False --cleanup-intermediate-files True --min-seqs-per_sample 100 --correlation-method Spearman etc etc\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this second example, even if you don't know exactly what the program is doing, you hopefully have some sort of a guess as to what each parameter means. For example --input-sequence-dir ./genome_sequences might indicate that the program will run an analysis on all the sequence files in a directory, and you're telling it that it should do that for the genome_sequences directory, which is in your current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a bit more formal, for each valued parameter you put one or two dashes (depending on the program) and then the name of the parameter you want to set. After that you put a space and then the value you want to set that parameter to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some programs, valued parameters have short one letter codes that can be accessed with a single dash. So for example instead of having to write out --input-sequence-dir ./genome_sequences, you might just be able to write -i ./genome sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bioinformatics programs that run on the command line have large numbers of valued parameters that you can adjust. **flag parameters** are one way that programmers try to make interacting with these programs a little simpler. A flag parameter works just like a valued parameter, except you don't have to supply a value. So for example, running a program with the --verbose flag parameter might mean that it will print out wordy or 'verbose' text output to the screen as it runs. "

    "#### Key Concept: relative paths refer to locations, but are not themselves commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's connect what we've just discussed about the `cd` command with our earlier discussion of relative and absolute paths. A common misconception when learning to navigate the command line is confusing the shortcuts for relative paths with commands. Think of relative or absolute paths as nouns, and the commands as verbs. Saying ../station/ is like saying 'the gas station around the corner'. It refers to a spot, but doesn't tell you what you should do with or at that spot. It is only by *pairing* a relative path with a command (or, more formally, supplying a relative path as an argument to a command) that we provide all the information needed to do something. Here are a couple of examples, along with an informal equivalent using our gas station analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `../station` 'the gas station around the corner' \n",
    "- `cd` 'go to'\n",
    "- `ls` 'look around'\n",
    "- `cd ../station` 'go to the gas station around the corner'\n",
    "- `ls ../station` 'look around the gas station around the corner'\n",
    "- `rm -rf ../station` 'destroy the gas station around the corner, and obliterate its rubble'\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful with that last command until you are very comfortable using command line interfaces - it will delete a directory and all of it's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try it yourself**: you can try out typing just a path (`../`) into your command line interface. You will get an error message, because `../` is not the name of a program. Just as telling a friend, \"Hey! Go to!\" or \"Hey! The Gas station around the corner!\" doesn't make much sense under most circumstances, saying just `cd` or just `../station` also isn't a complete command. If you experiment with this a little, you will notice that some commands, like `pwd` and `ls` can be run on their own. This is because they do not require any positional arguments to run, or because they have default parameters that they use if no arguments are supplied. For example, if you don't provide a relative path, `ls` assumes you would like to look around your current working directory. Other commands require you to supply one or more arguments to work.\n",
