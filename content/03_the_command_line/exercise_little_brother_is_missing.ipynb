    "**The first word is the command, the next word(s) are arguments**. When we are using BASH commands like `cd` `ls` etc, the first word you type must be the name of a command (not e.g. a file or directory. Subsequent words say what to run the command on or modify what it does. Many commands like `cd` don't work without arguments (i.e. arguments are required). If you just type `cd`, it's a little like shouting 'CHANGE DIRECTORY!'. Your poor command line interface has no idea which directory to change to! On the other hand `cd start_here` tells it to change to the start_here directory in the current working directory. If there are multiple arguments required by a command they must be separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting old commands back**. You can use the up and down arrows to get old commands back. Just hit the up arrow and your last command will appear. If you hit enter it will run again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting 'up' one directory**. To head to the directory that encloses your current directory (so 'down' on the map), you can use `cd ..`. This works because `..` is always a shortcut for whatever directory encloses the current working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "**tab-completion**. Some names of folders and files are *very* hard to type. You can shortcut this using tab completion. This is normally enabled by default but in some cases might not be available. Basically, if you type enough of a file or folder name that the computer can tell you mean that one and no others, you can hit tab and have it fill the rest in for you. This is very useful in `the_mire_of_filename_madness`. So for example, if you were in `the_village` and wanted to head to `home_sweet_home`, you could type:\n",
    "`cd ho`\n",
    "Instead of hitting enter, you could then hit tab. BASH would autocomplete what you typed to read:\n",
    "`cd home_sweet_home`.\n",
    "This is awesome because it *both* speeds up your typing *and* helps avoid unnecessary spelling errors. If you have computer-savvy friends who look like they are typing at million miles an hour when working in BASH, it is likely that they are using tab-completion a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "**most programs need relative or absolute paths to find files and folders**. Look at the map up above. If you are in the `start_here` folder and type `cd the_zoo`, you will get an error message. This is because, even though you have a folder called `the_zoo` on your computer, it is not in your current working directory. In other words, `cd` can't search your whole computer for this folder - you have to tell it *exactly* how to get there from where you are now (a relative path) or from the root of the file system (an absolute path). This may seem cumbersome, but it gets easier over time, and helps prevent accidentally running your code on the wrong file later on. \n"
