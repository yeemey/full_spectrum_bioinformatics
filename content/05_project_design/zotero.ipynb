    "*My first scientific publication was a review paper on the intra- and intercellular mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer. I hoped that organizing information about the traces these different gene transfer mechanisms left in the DNA might help inform the development of better tools for detecting transferred genes in bacterial genomes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The review ultimately cited 96 scientific papers. Unfortunately, I was formatting my references using a process that involved a lot of manual steps. Due to a misunderstanding on my part about the journal's formatting requirements, I had to reformat them all by hand more than once during revision of the manuscript. This is not even a huge number of citations relative to many papers, but I definitely felt pretty miserable during the process.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*The goal of this chapter is for you to never have to reformat large numbers of citations by hand, and instead to be able to include professional-grade citations throughout your research project, with a References section added automatically at the end. Luckily, there are several outstanding **reference managers** that can help you to do this. These are software packages that can collect, organize, and cite papers from the literature. Many can automatically fill in both inline citations and your references section. If you have to change formats, you can simply select a different format, and your bibliography will be automatically updated.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*To describe how to use Zotero, a good free reference management software package, I've invited [Dr. Mushtaq Bilal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p3NllOUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

    "One of the best ways to pick up the conventions of a particular academic journal or academic subfield is simply to carefully study multiple examples of published articles from that target journal, or written in that area of specialty. This doesn't have to take a long time (well under an hour), but can be immensely helpful in getting the right 'feel' for using citations in a way that will read as professional to practitioners in that area. \n",

    "**Exercise 1**. Pick a paper relevant to your project, and focus on one paragraph in the introduction that has a few citations, and describe each of the following:\n",
    "    - The style of the citations. Do they use direct quotations? Are inline citations numbered (1), or do they include the first author's family name and the year of publication (Bilal 2019)? A last name and a page number? Or is some other system used?\n",
    "    - The density of citations. Roughly how often do authors use citations? Is more than one citation ever used in a single sentence (e.g. if multiple papers address the same topic)? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2**. Now scroll to the references list at the end. How is it labelled? Different journals may use 'References' (probably most common in Bioinformatics), 'Bibliography' or 'Works Cited'. Some review journals even include annotated bibliographies where the most important references are highlighted with special markings and include brief descriptions by the author.\n",
