A team member is writing a new function to calculate k-mer content, while you are working on code to download genomes from NCBI. Along the way, you both also make some fixes to the existing code. Now you meet and have to try to combine your work. But which lines changed, and in which files? While its certainly possible to sort out, its time consuming, and very easy to make mistakes when combining your work. GitHub helps with this by being able to automatically merging changes from different team members (as long as they don't directly contradict or *conflict* with each other)."

    "### Overview of the life cycle of a GitHub pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "For collaborative projects, the best way to make changes is through 'pull requests'. The basic idea is that each group member will make changes in their own local copy of the project, then \"push\" those changes up to their cloud copy or 'fork' of the project on the GitHub website. From there, they will request that the group incorporate the changes by issuing what is known as a \"pull request\". A different member of the group will then look over the changes, and if everything looks good merge the changes into the main project. This process means that at least 2 people will look at all changes, which can help prevent mistakes, and that each change is well documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, it takes a total of 7 steps to update your local and cloud projects, create a new branch of the project to work on, make and commit changes to your files, then push them back up to your fork of the project in the cloud, and finally request that the main group account incorporate your changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This feels like a lot of commands the first time, and that is very normal! The first couple times, it can be very helpful to have someone familiar with the process walk you through it. However, I promise it gets easier with practice and repeatition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will discuss in detail each step, what its doing, and why that makes sense. However, in case that's overwhelming, here's a short list of the commands we'll be using. The commands assume the shared project will be labelled `upstream`, your personal cloud copy or fork will be labelled `origin`, and the main branch will be labelled `main`. In this example, we're adding some data to a file called `my_file.txt`, so we've named our branch (i.e. the label for the topic we're working on) `add_data`.\n",

    "\n",

    "**Step 3:** Create a branch called add_data and switch to it\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `git checkout -b add_data`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps 4 & 5:** Make our changes, add changed files, and commit the changes \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `git add my_file.txt`\n",
    "5. `git commit -m \"Updated my_file.txt\" to add additional data.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat these steps as many times as needed to do the task that's the focus of this branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Push the branch with our changes up to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `git push origin add_data`\n",

    "**Step 7:** Issue a pull request.\n",

    "### Steps 1 & 2. Updating your local and cloud repositories to the main project\n",
    "\n",
    "In collaborative projects, it's possible that someone on your team has made some improvements to the main project repository since the last time you worked on it. It greatly simplifies things if before you start making new changes, you update your local copy and your personal fork of the project on the GitHub website to match the main project. There are several ways to do this. For this guide, we will first use a `git pull` command to update our local `main` branch with any changes to the main project. Then we will use a `git push` to push our (now updated) local `main` branch up to our fork in the cloud. Note that in older repositories `main` used to be called `master`. If that is the case in your project, just replace `main` in the commands with `master` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, these commands will look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**. Update your local `main` branch from the `upstream` shared project repository\n",
    "`git pull upstream main`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**. Push changes in your local `main` branch up into your personal fork in GitHub.\n",
    " `git push origin master`\n",
    " \n",
    " Note that somewhat confusingly the syntax for `git pull` and `git push` is opposite. `git pull` has arguments `<source>` then `<destination>`, whereas `git push` has arguments `<destination>` then `<source>`. So in the first command we pull from `upstream` to `main`, but in the second we push changes into `origin` from `main`.\n",
    " \n",
    " If that worked then congratulations! Your project should now be up to date. We are now ready to create a new branch on which to make changes. The diagram below summarizes what we've done so far:"
