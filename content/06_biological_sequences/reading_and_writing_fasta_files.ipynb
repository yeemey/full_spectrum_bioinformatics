    "As we have seen, sequence data is ubiquitous in computational biology and bioinformatics. One of the most straightforward methods of representing that data is as a FASTA file. [FASTA format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files are simply text files. They may have various file extensions including .txt, .fa, .fasta, .fna or .faa. Typically, .fna indicates a nucleotide fasta file, whereas .faa indicates an amino acid fasta file. The name FASTA format orginates from the name of an old program, FASTA, that was the first to use this format. But now many different programs in bioinformatics use this format.\n",

The identifier line also indicates that all following lines are sequence, until you reach either another identifier line or the end of the file. In some cases, identifier lines *may* also contain additional information about the sequence - like it's putative function - but this entirely depends on the specific database or research group that wrote the FASTA file. In our example file, the identifier line is: `>tr|R9WNI0|R9WNI0_HUMAN Fragile X mental retardation 1 OS=Homo sapiens OX=9606 GN=FMR1 PE=1 SV=1`\n",

Your text editor may wrap this around so it looks like multiple lines, but as far as the computer is concerned it's just one. In other FASTA files, like this one, long sequences are broken up into multiple lines, each with no more than a certain number of characters (here 60). \n",

Similarly, when we use `line = line.replace('\\n','')`, all we are really trying to do is to remove whitespace from the end of the line. This can also be accomplished with the `strip` string method. Substituting these two doesn't change the outcome, but in my opinion makes our code a little bit more clear: "

    "Let's try writing our results to a file. This will be very similar to when we wrote lines to a FASTA file, but now let's try writing our data in a tab-delimited format. That means that a tab (`'\\t'`) character will separate our data into columns. We can use the `join` string method to join together a list of results using a particular delimiter. In the code below, the expression `\"\\t\".join([seq_id,seq])+\"\\n\"` says to join together the sequence identifier and the sequence using a tab character, then add a newline (`'\\n'`) on the end."

    "**Write an example FASTA file using python**. Your file should contain three sequences, and be in the FASTA format. Don't write it by hand in a text editor! The point is to practice writing things like this into files using python. \n",

    "Seq_1 has sequence 'ATGCTGGGTACGATCGTACGTACGTACG'\n",
    "Seq_2 has sequence 'ATCGCGGGGCTATATCTGGATTTTTAAACGGATCG'\n",

    "**Write a FASTA file with 1000 random sequences with equal base frequency**. Each of the entries in your FASTA file should first have an identifier line, and then one or more lines of random sequence generated by your code. *Hint*: The choice function, which you can import using `from random import choice` selects a random item from a list. So for example, `choice([True,False])` would randomly return either True or False with equal probability. You can use this function to help you generate the random sequences by choosing among a list of nucleotides. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Use the parse_fasta_file function on a real genome**. The [PATRIC](https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/2#view_tab=genomes) database allows for downloading of whole bacterial genomes in a convenient way. Check a box for a complete genome of interest, then click the download (`DNLD`) button on the right, and select one of the protein or nucleotide FASTA files. Unzip the file, then inspect it in a text editor to make sure it looks like a valid FASTA file. Assuming it does, run the code on this file to parse it. Using the resulting dictionary, calculate some statistics about the genome. How many sequences were present? What was the average length of the sequences? What was their average GC content?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add code to the parse_fasta_file function to remove alignment gap characters from a FASTA file**. Some FASTA files have special gap characters (`'-'`) that are added during sequence alignment to reflect insertions or deletions with respect to some other sequence. Add code that removes any gap `-` characters in the sequence lines of the input file. Test that your code works by making a test FASTA file that has - characters in the sequences and also at least one id line. Make sure the - characters in the sequence are removed, but the ones in the id line are not. *Hint* replacing a character with the empty string `''` is equivalent to removing it. *Extension*: modify the parse_fasta_file function to take an extra parameter called remove_gaps. If set to True, the function should remove gap characters, but if it is set to False it should not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add convert_to_uppercase and convert_to_lowercase options to the parse_fasta_file function**. Some bioinformatic programs accept only uppercase or lowercase sequences, so it is useful to have a way to easily convert between the two. Add new parameters to the parse_fasta_file function that optionally convert the sequences (but NOT the identifiers) to either all uppercase or all lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extend the FASTA file writing code to ensure each sequence line is 80 characters or less in length**. Test your code with sequences of length 10, 100, 200 and 240. *Hint* if the length of the sequence is less than 80 characters, you can just write the whole thing into the file at once on a single line. *Hint 2* If the length of the sequence is more than 80 characters, you can break it up into a number of 80 character chunks, each of which will fit exactly on one line, plus one chunk of 'leftovers' that will be less than 80 characters."
